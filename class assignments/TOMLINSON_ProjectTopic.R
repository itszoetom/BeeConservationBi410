General Topic of Interest Related to the Oregon Bee Atlas Data:

Exploring the impact of forest fires on bee populations in Oregon, with a focus 
on potential correlations between fire incidents and bee population dynamics, 
such as diversity patterns, relocation behaviors, and potential sampling biases.

Research Questions

How do forest fires influence the geographic relocation of bee populations?

What impact do forest fires have on the diversity of bee species in affected 
regions?

Are there shifts in bee diet patterns following forest fires due to changes in 
flora?

Additional Relevant Datasets
Oregon Department of Forestry Fire Occurrence Data: This dataset, spanning from 
2000-2022, offers detailed information on wildfire incidents across Oregon, 
including location, date, and fire causes. This data is accessible at: ODF Fire 
Occurrence Data.

Additional Potential Sources: 
Federal or academic repositories like the National Interagency Fire Center 
(NIFC) for multi-state fire data, and environmental data resources such as 
EPA Air Quality data, which could be correlated to bee relocation and health 
post-fire.
