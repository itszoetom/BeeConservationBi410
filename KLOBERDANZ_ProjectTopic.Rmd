General topic of interest in relation to the Oregon Bee Atlas data (e.g., patterns of diversity, bee diets, sampling bias)
- Patterns of diversity
Potential questions within that topic area
- Can bee species density in a certain region predict air quality in that region? 
- Does population density predict bee species density? 

- Partner: Zoe Tomlinson
 
 
 - overlay severity of fires data and see the populations of bees

 - A/B test to shuffle severities 
 - For each severity, create a polygon and set all the bee points within these boundaries for each severity
 - bees in that severity divided by bees in that region
