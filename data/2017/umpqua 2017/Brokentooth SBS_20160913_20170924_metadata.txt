    Description
        Abstract: These data products are preliminary burn severity assessments derived from Landsat 8 OLI and Landsat 7 ETM+ data. The pre-fire and post-fire subsets included were used to create a differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) image. The dNBR image attempts to portray the variation of burn severity within a fire. The severity ratings are influenced by the effects to the canopy.  The severity rating is based upon a composite of the severity to the understory (grass, shrub layers), midstory trees and overstory trees. Because there is often a strong correlation between canopy consumption and soil effects, this algorithm works in many cases for BAER teams whose objective is a soil burn severity assessment.  It is not, however, appropriate in all ecosystems or fires. It is expected that BAER teams will adjust the thresholds to match field observations to produce a soil burn severity.
        Purpose: These data were created by the USDA Forest Service Geospatial Technology and Applications Center (GTAC) to support Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) teams.

    Access Constraints: Thresholded, preliminary severity estimates (BARC4 and BARC256) are only delivered to BAER teams. Further distribution is at the discretion of the BAER team leader. Pre-imagery, post-imagery, and unthresholded data are publicly available on http://activefiremaps.fs.fed.us/baer/download.php. Access to pre-imagery and post-imagery may be limited when sensors other than Landsat or other government remote sensing assets are used due to product licensing restrictions.
    Use Constraints:  There are no restrictions on use, except for reasonable and proper acknowledgement of information sources and limitations as preliminary/draft data.

    Lineage
        Process Step
            Process Description: These data products are derived from Landsat 8 OLI and Landsat 7 ETM+ data. Pre-fire and post-fire scenes are analyzed to create a differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) image. The dNBR image portrays the variation of burn severity within the fire. The pre- and post-fire images are terrain corrected and further processed to convert top of atmosphere reflectance. 
                The Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) is computed for the pre- and post-fire images using the following formula:
                (NIR Band - SWIR Band) / (NIR Band + SWIR Band) = NBR

                The Differenced NBR is computed to determine severity by subtracting the post-fire NBR from the pre-fire NBR:
                (PreNBR - PostNBR) = dNBR

                The BARC products are a generalization of the raw, continuous dNBR dataset. Both BARC products have been resampled to unsigned 8-bit GeoTIFF and are easily viewed and edited within ArcGIS.

                The classes represented on the BARC products are created with thresholds chosen by an analyst at GTAC.  These thresholds can be roughly related back to original dNBR values by multiplying by 5 and then subtracting 275 (for example, a BARC256 value of 100 would relate to a dNBR value of 225).  The BARC thresholds used on this particular fire are:
                Unburned / Undetectable: All values less than or equal to 70.
                Low: All values greater than 70 and less than or equal to 104.
                Moderate: All values greater than 104 and less than or equal to 182.
                High: All values greater than 182.

                General descriptions of the severity classes are below:
                Unburned / Undetectable: This means the area after the fire was indistinguishable from pre-fire conditions. This does not always indicate the area did not burn (i.e. canopy may be occluding the burn signal).
                Low: This severity class represents areas of surface fire with little detected change in cover and little detected mortality of the dominant vegetation.
                Moderate: This severity class is between low and high and means there is a mixture of detected effects on the dominant vegetation.
                High: This severity class represents areas where the canopy has high to complete consumption.

    Sequence of steps used to create Soil Burn Severity data: see comments below
    
    Additional Comments:Field observations revealed low intensity ground fire that was masked from aerial and satellite observations, meaning that the original BARC breaks are under representing low intensity burns.
  Also based on field visits, the high intensity burn seems to be under reported by the original breaks.  Moving the low burn threshold from 70 to 59 resulted in a fair amount of scattered single pixels of low burn 
outside the fire perimeter, but paints a much more representative picture of the burn with in the perimeter as observed in the field.
Field teams targeted visits to areas with high and moderate intensities as identified on the initial BARC and observed from aerial recon flights.  This allowed some of the data gap areas to be filled in but the 
majority of the data gaps could not be visited on the ground.  The team decided to fill the remaining gaps with ‘low’ burn intensity.  The team feels that most if not all of the moderate and high burns have been 
captured and that the remaining gaps are a mosaic of low and unburned.  By filling the remaining gaps with ‘low’ the assumption is that we will err on the side of over-representing low intensity burn and under 
represent the unburned area.  The result is an SBS map that has a strongly banded appearance.  Polygons with interpolated burn severity are attributed as such in the attribute table.  Maps showing the SBS will also 
feature a mask delineating the polygons where severity was interpolated without field observations.
The fire perimeter had to be adjusted to include a few spot fires and burned areas adjacent to the mapped perimeter.
